# Gradle Notes

We all love to hate Gradle. Even so, Gradle is a very powerful build system and with great power one usually gets great... complexity!
I've created this repo to keep some notes on solutions for problems that I come across while using the Gradle build system, sometimes after a few hours of research. I hope those can help someone in the feature, even if that someone is my future self.

Feel free to steal anything.
